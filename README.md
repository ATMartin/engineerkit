   <summary><b>Pulling upstream changes from <a href="https://github.com/engineerkit/engineerkit">engineerkit/engineerkit</a> into your private fork</b></summary><br/>

  While we always promote sharing with the open source community, some companies might find it necessary to privately fork EngineerKit if they have some software engineering standards they want to keep to themselves. Here's a quick guide on how to do this with EngineerKit:

  - First clone down your private repo
  - To add a new remote to your local repo connected to the `engineerkit/engineerkit` repo, run
    ```
    git remote add public git@github.com:engineerkit/engineerkit.git
    ``` 
  - To create a branch where you'll pull changes into, run
    ```
    git checkout -b add_awesome_new_topics
    ```
  - To pull down changes into your new branch, run
    ```
    git pull public main
    ```
  - Resolve any merge conflicts
  - To push up your changes to your private fork, run
    ```
    git push
    ```
