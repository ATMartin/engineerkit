## Difficulty Rating

To help an apprentice and mentor know what to expect when tackling a module, we assign a difficulty level for each module using the standard trail rating system used for outdoor activities. 

| Difficulty | Description | Time to Complete |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%97%8F%20Easy-brightgreen?style=flat-square) | An “Easy” rating represents a brief overview of each topic in the module with some light skill-building | Less than a week |
| ![Moderate](https://img.shields.io/badge/■%20Moderate-blue?style=flat-square) | A “Moderate” rating represents a thorough overview of each topic in the module with some skill-building | Less than two weeks |
| ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/◆%20Hard-grey?style=flat-square) | A “Hard” rating represents an in-depth exploration of each topic in the module with heavy skill-building | Less than a month |
