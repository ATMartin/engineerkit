   #### Learning Outcomes
   * Describe the concept of “acceptance criteria”
   * Compare manual and automated testing methods
   * List the team perspectives that should be considered in task requirements
   * Theorize how you might validate and simplify requirements given to you

   <summary><b>Test Patterns</b></summary><br/>

   With this topic, you’ll learn about common test patterns such as the four-phase test, inside-out testing, and other practical techniques to make writing automated tests more efficient and enjoyable.
   
   #### Learning Outcomes
   * Describe the four phases of a test and their purpose
   * Create unit tests using the four-phase approach
   * Explain why the four phase test pattern is important, and how you'd apply it
   * List common test patterns
   * Describe common test fixture patterns and their use cases
   * Describe the inside-out and outside-in test patterns and their purpose
   * Explain a scenario where you would use the inside-out test pattern
