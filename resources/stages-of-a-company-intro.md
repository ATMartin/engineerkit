# Stages of a Company Introduction

### The Stages of a Company:
**START** - (Startup company)
**SCALE** - (Growth-stage company)
**SUSTAIN** - (Enterprise company)
**SHIFT** - (Enterprise company-corporate innovation)

### Mapping of Company Stages to its Journey Toward PMF:
**START** - Startups **search** for PMF
**SCALE** - Growth-stage companies **accelerate** after they found the beginning of PMF
**SUSTAIN** - Enterprise companies seek to **sustain the success** of PMF
**SHIFT** - Enterprise companies look to **revitalize** the current PMF or **search** for a new one

### Goals per Company Stage:
**START** - Startups value **discovery** and **“failing fast”** toward **validating** a **business model** in an **early market** (pre-chasm), specifically if they can repeatedly create demand and sell their MVP that solves a target users’ mission critical need, before their investment cash runs out
**SCALE** - Growth-stage companies turn their attention toward **exponential growth** and **profitability** through **“crossing the chasm”** from the early market to the **mainstream market**, by validating and executing on the different needs and buying patterns of the mainstream. This goes hand in hand with scaling up the core product and business to keep pace with growing market share.
**SUSTAIN** - Enterprise companies seek to **sustain and reap the success** of the found PMF in the mainstream market by **growing revenue** through consistency in providing new value and competitive differentiation through **sustaining innovation** to evolving needs and through **technology innovation** to optimize and reduce costs.
**SHIFT** - As a PMF business line dwindles, enterprise companies look to **sunset/sell** the product line, **revitalize** it through modernization or rebranding efforts, or restart the process by **searching for a new market demand** and product-market fit (innovator's dilemma) before they go out of business
