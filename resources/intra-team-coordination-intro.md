**What a product manager expects of a their software developers:**
- **Product Strategy Feasibility** - Is our team(s) capable of accomplishing these milestones? Do we have the right skills? Technology? Is the sequence right?
- **Product Release Plan Feasibility** - Is our team(s) capable of accomplishing these "epics"/features? How large is the relative effort for each? Is there enough margin in place for unknowns and maintenance?
- **Product Increment Feasibility** - Is our team capable of accomplishing these "stories"/features? Which of these tasks can you commit to completing in the next iteration?
- **Keeping Promises** - Did you knock out what you committed to completing to the "definition of done" we agree to?
