# Product Life Cycle Stages Introduction

### Stages of a Product’s Life Cycle:
- **New Product**
- **Growth**
- **Product Expansion**
- **Harvesting**
- **End-of-Life**

### Mapping of Company and Product Stages:
- **New Product** - START (startup) or SHIFT (Enterprise)
- **Growth** - SCALE (Growth-stage company)
- **Product Expansion** - SCALE (Growth-stage company)
- **Harvesting** - SUSTAIN (Enterprise)
- **End-of-Life** - SHIFT (Enterprise)

### Goals of Each Product Stage:
- **New Product** - The goal is to create the first version of the product, or the **minimal viable product (MVP)**, and to **remain low cost and nimble** to likely changing feature ideas as assumptions about the target users are rapidly prototyped, tested and validated.
- **Growth** - The goal is to have a product that can **scale to sustain a large increase of usage** as many new customers are coming to use the product, while also **enhancing the user experience** of the features that are most used from the MVP or **pruning features** that have not been essential.
- **Product Expansion** - The goal is to identity and **keep the core of the product stable and flexible** to allow for capturing new market verticals with new needs, or the mainstream needs of the current market, through the addition of fresh functionality on top of the core features or through “platform” or “white-labeling” efforts.
- **Harvesting** - The goal is to **ensure uptime, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and to keep risk low** so as to not disrupt the product’s brand, its promises, its reputation, or the consistent revenue coming in from the “cash cow” product, all while responding quickly to customer feedback.
- **End-of-Life** - The goal is to **keep brand and SLA promises to the end**, and to **ensure minimal disruption** to stakeholders as services/features are transitioned or brought offline.
