# Inter-team Coordination Introduction

**The core philosophies of controlling process that have influenced Waterfall and Agile software development:**
- **Defined Process Control** - A model that requires every piece of work to be understood. Given a well-defined set of inputs, the same outputs are generated every time.
  - Closed information system
    - No need for feedback loops
  - Lay out the plan of action
    - Trust the plan and avoid change
  - Destination is known
- **Empirical Process Control** - A model that provides and exercises control through transparency, frequent inspection, and adaptation for processes that are imperfectly defined and generate unpredictable and unrepeatable outputs.
- Open information system
  - Need for feedback loops
- Discover the plan as you go
  - Trust the act of planning, not the plan
- Destination is dynamic or unknown
