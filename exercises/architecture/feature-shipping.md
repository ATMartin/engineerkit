# Exercise: Feature Shipping

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Ship a small feature using the ramp up technique |
| Duration | 4-8 hours |

Not only is the 12 Factor App a great resource for conceptualizing modern apps, it can also be helpful in mapping out your understanding of a codebase. For example, you can use the "backing service" concept to understand the boundaries of the codebase and the services that are required in order for it to run.

Another method to quickly understand what is going on in a codebase, is to use the C4 modeling technique. This allows you to gain an understanding of the total context of a software system. 

## Steps

Use the following steps to help you progress through the exercise (use your own judgement, these are not precise steps):

1. Find a small feature that you can work on and complete in less than a day
2. Use the C4 modeling technique to build a clear understanding of where your code is in the systen. 
3. Gain an understanding of code adjacent to the feature you're creating.  
4. Create the feature (don't forget to use TDD).
5. Make sure that other parts of the system weren't negatively impacted. 
6. Share the results with your mentor. 

## Questions

Use these questions to guide your curiosity during the exercise:

- What is C4 modeling?
- How can you increase your confidence that your code didn't break other parts of the system?

## Reflection

Use the following questions to reflect on what you learned with this exercise and discuss with your mentor:

- What surprised you about this exercise?
- If you were to mentor someone in the future, what highlights would you make sure they captured from this exercise? 
- What would be your next step? What resources can support you in this next step?
- When you connect with your mentor after this next step, what do you hope to share with them? To celebrate?
