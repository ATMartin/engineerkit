## Steps

1. Open your text editor, and start a basic web project using your preferred web technologies. If you need extra help getting a web project started using Google's Material design, checkout their getting started page [here](https://material.io/develop/web/getting-started).
2. Create a login page in your project.
3. Using Material design import and use these components to build the mockup below:
    - [Text input](https://material.io/components/text-fields)
    - [Buttons](https://material.io/components/buttons)<img width="1440" src="login-wireframe.png">
4. Read the documentation and use the components properly.
5. Once you're done creating the ui, feel free to style it or make it your own using [material's theming capabilities](https://material.io/develop/web/theming/theming-guide). Try playing with color or shape!
6. Once you're done, grab your mentor and discuss!
